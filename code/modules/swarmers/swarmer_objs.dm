						2. Ensure protection of the beacon so this location can be invaded at a later date; do not perform actions that would render this location dangerous or inhospitable.\n\
						3. Biological resources will be harvested at a later date: do not harm them.\n\
						OPERATOR NOTES:\n\
						- Consume resources to construct traps, barriers, and follower drones.\n\
						- Follower drones can be ordered to move via middle clicking on a tile. While drones cannot assist in resource harvesting, they can protect you from threats.\n\
						- LCTRL + attacking an organic will allow you to remove said organic from the area.\n\
						- You and your drones have a stun effect on melee. You are also armed with a disabler projectile, use these to prevent organics from halting your progress.\n\
