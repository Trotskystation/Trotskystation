I'll have to refine the process more before sending a sample to Centcom, but soon we won't have to waste thousands of credits sending those miners to work in this... hellscape anymore. The rest of my mineral samples remained stable too. I'll just have to hope those Space Pirates won't track me down after I stole their trisulfideoxide again... I've hidden the recipe in the safe for now. Code is 8124."
