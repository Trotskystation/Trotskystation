### Intent of your Pull Request

Explain what the purpose of your PR is.
Mention if you tested your changes. If you changed a map, make sure you used the mapmerge tool.

Mention if your PR is related to an issue.
You can type "Fixes issue #6" and issue 6 will be automatically closed when your pull request is merged. This is much easier for everyone.

Edit the changelog at the bottom for changes that are noticeable by the players. Remove it if this isn't the case.
If you add a name after the ':cl', that name will be used in the changelog. Leave it empty to use your GitHub name.
Prefix the PR title with [admin] if it's something admin related.
Prefix the PR title with [s] if you are fixing an exploit so it is not announced on discord and the server.
