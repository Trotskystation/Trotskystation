# The Rules
Hi. Thanks a lot for reading these. If you have any questions on any of the rules do not hesitate to adminhelp (using F1 in-game) or message a member of staff/leadership on Discord.

## Core Rules
These apply everywhere.

### 0.0: Don't be a dick. Don't behave in a manner that goes out of its way to deprive the enjoyment of others. These rules are not an exhaustive list. Rules-lawyering is strongly discouraged. If an admin asks you to knock something off, 'well it's not in the rules' is not an argument. The staff team maintains the right to arbitrarily remove people that are a clear detriment to the community as a whole.

**0.1: Listen to admins.** Everything is subject to admin discretion. If you cannot be contacted, you may be banned and have you explain your part of the story on the forums. Ignoring admin PMs, lying, insulting admins or other players, et cetera will be counted against you and will lead to a ban.

**0.2: Erotic content is forbidden.** As a general rule, anything more sexualized than kissing and hugging is considered erotic. Do not roleplay acts of an erotic nature. Do not write, upload, or distribute pornographic literature, images, etc.

**0.3: Do not metacommunicate or multikey.** You are only allowed to participate on this server on a single BYOND account. Do not try to join with a different account to continue playing. Only use in-game means of communication. Obviously cooperating with other players via outside communications will net a permanent ban.

**0.4: Do not abuse bugs.** If you see a bug, report it.

**0.5: Do not mix IC (in character) and OOC (out of character) knowledge.** Do not post information related to a round in progress in the OOC chat or anywhere on the Github or Discord. A person reading the OOC chat should not be able to know what the gamemode is, whether anyone is dead, etc.

**0.6: Do not spam or advertise.**

**0.7: Speak English.** Speaking in languages the admins do not understand in either IC or OOC can be treated as metacommunications.


## Server Rules
Core Rules apply on the server.

**1.0: Keep the game fun.** This is the golden rule of the server. The admins have the right and responsibility to let you break the rules in this section when you are doing something fun, and fully enforce them when you are not. Act maliciously at your own peril. If you're worried something you're about to do might result in punishment, press F1 and adminhelp to ask if you can do it.

**1.1: Do not metagame.** Your character does not know everything you do. If you die and return as a new character, act as a new character. Do not use knowledge you learned in previous lives.

**1.2: Do not use OOC terminology, slang, slurs, or "netspeak" IC.**  If helping someone or necessary use LOOC to communicate.  Abusing OOC, LOOC, or discord to insult others or create a toxic environment will result in an OOC/LOOC/discord ban.

**1.3: Use a realistic name.** Human characters should have at least a first and last name. Obscene names or names that are similar in look or pronunciation to obscene phrases are forbidden. Avoid using famous names or names of other fictional characters. Do not include honorifics in your name. Clowns, mimes, and other wacky or novel roles do not need a realistic name.

**1.4: Pick roles that you actually intend to play.**  Do not repeatedly commit suicide at roundstart when playing any job with limited slots. Assistants are exempt from this rule.

**1.5: Do your job when you're a critical role,** such as Security, head of staff, or antagonist. Do not abandon the station or hide in a closet the whole game. Adminhelp if you must leave the game while playing a critical role.

### Non-Antagonist Rules
Rules that only apply to players that are not Antagonists.

**1.1.0: Do not murderbone.** Engage in murder and aggravated assault at your own peril. Do not distribute harmful chemicals or genetic modifications without labels and the consent of your victim. If admins deem your killings or violence to be unfun, you will be punished.

**1.1.1: Do not powergame.** Do not collect dangerous items or fortify the station without reasonable cause to do so.


### Antagonist Rules
Server & Core rules still apply as Antagonist.

**1.2.0: Have a reason for any players you kill.** You must be able to relate any murder to accomplishing your objectives.

**1.2.1: Don't teamkill when part of a team.** "Lone wolf" antagonists, such as traitors or changelings, do not need to follow this rule.

**1.2.2: Do not spawncamp Arrivals,** or render it uninhabitable.


## Discord Rules
Core Rules still apply on Discord.

**2.0: Keep discussion where it should be.** Keep your discussion related to the topic of the channel you're talking in. Keep degenerate or otherwise vaguely-NSFW discussion in `#off-topic` and `#memes`.


## Github Rules
Core Rules still apply on Github.

**3.0: Follow the Contribution guide** when contributing code.
